## Calculator Logic
The project calculator solves: "I have X sq ft, how many rolls do I need?"

**Inputs:** Width (ft), Length (ft)
**Outputs:**
- Rolls needed (based on 15ft width constraint)
- Linear feet to order
- Seam tape (linear feet)
- Infill bags (50lb each, 1-1.5 lbs/sqft)
- Waste percentage

**Formula:**
```
rollsAcross = ceil(projectWidth / 15)
linearFeetTotal = rollsAcross * projectLength
seamCount = rollsAcross - 1 (if > 1)
seamTapeFeet = seamCount * projectLength
infillLbs = squareFeet * (isPetTurf ? 1.5 : 1.0)
```
